= home_to_my_page

A very simple redmine plugin that will redirect signed-in users to My Page when they sign-in or when they click the home link in the website header.

Tested with redmin 3.2.x

Install to redmine/plugins directory. No migrations are needed.

== TODO 

- Write some simple test cases
